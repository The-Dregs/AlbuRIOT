title: AlbuRIOT Documentation Map

applyTo: '**'

# Canonical document locations (with fallbacks)
- Resolve docs by checking these bases in order and using the first that exists:
  1) `Assets/docs/`
  2) `ALBURIOT/Assets/docs/`
  3) `docs/` (repo root)
  4) repo root files (for individually moved files)

- Expected files in `Assets/docs/` (resolve via the rules above):
  - **Core design**: `CHAPTER 1 - 3.md` (canonical thesis basis), `CHAPTER 3.md` (game design chapter), `ALBURIOT_GDD.md` (derived GDD)
  - **Game mechanics**: `ENEMY_MOVES.md` (enemy stats/formulas), `ENEMY MOVESETS.TXT` (animation/VFX notes), `POWERSTEALING_MOVES.md` (power-steal mechanics), `ALGORITHMS.md` (math/definitions), `FORMULAS.txt` (plain formulas), `GDLC.txt` (lifecycle plan)
  - **Setup guides**: `NUNO_TRADING_SETUP.md` (comprehensive trading system setup), `NUNO_TRADING_QUICKSTART.md` (quick trading setup)

# Referencing rules
- Use `CHAPTER 3.md` for chapter beats, objectives, and placements; treat `CHAPTER 1 - 3.md` as the canonical basis if conflicts arise.
- Cite documents by their resolved relative path, e.g., `Assets/docs/CHAPTER 3.md` or `docs/CHAPTER 3.md`.
- If a document is missing, ask to create it under the highest-priority base that exists.
 - For enemy stats and timing, cite `ENEMY_MOVES.md` (numbers) and `ENEMY MOVESETS.TXT` (animation/VFX intent).
 - For power-steal mechanics and player abilities, cite `POWERSTEALING_MOVES.md`.
 - For terrain/spawn/BT formulas, cite `ALGORITHMS.md` (math) or `FORMULAS.txt` (plain) as appropriate.
 - When summarizing design pillars, chapters, or MVP scope, cite `CHAPTER 3.md`; note it is derived from `CHAPTER 1 - 3.md` and should stay in sync.

# Sync notes
- Game mechanics docs (`CHAPTER 3.md`, `ENEMY_MOVES.md`, `ENEMY MOVESETS.TXT`, `ALGORITHMS.md`, `FORMULAS.txt`, `GDLC.txt`, `POWERSTEALING_MOVES.md`) are maintained in lockstep with `CHAPTER 1 - 3.md` (canonical basis).
- If discrepancies occur, defer to `CHAPTER 1 - 3.md` then update derivative docs accordingly.
- Setup guides (`NUNO_TRADING_SETUP.md`, `NUNO_TRADING_QUICKSTART.md`) reflect the current implementation in `Assets/Scripts/NPC/` and `Assets/Resources/Trades/`.

# File hygiene
- Use short, ASCII-only filenames. Avoid spaces where possible; prefer `-` or `_`.
- Keep documents in Markdown or plain text for easy diffing.
