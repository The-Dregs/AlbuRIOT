B. TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION
Project Context

The video game industry has proven to be an influential platform to share stories and preserve cultures through the provision of interactive experiences introducing people to varied histories, customs, and mythologies. As much as the greater part of the global audience has been targeted by games adapted from Norse, Greek, and Japanese mythology, Philippine mythology depiction is not present in most media platforms. Their neglect in mainstream media is to blame for the erosion over time of vibrant folklore that occupied an honored position in Philippine culture. By integrating local mythologies into interactive gameplay, games have the capability to educate, entertain, and preserve cultural heritage, especially among young people who perhaps never learned about traditional stories. AlbuRIOT, a survival multiplayer game, tries to fill this gap by bringing the Philippine mythological creatures to life and in color using dynamic and interactive gameplay.

Forgetting Philippine mythology from the country's contemporary population, particularly the younger generation, is of an urgent concern. As much as these myths once spread via word of mouth and local tales, new influences and globalized media stole attention from native folklores. Previous works of cultural representation in media emphasize the narrative's function to preserve the nation's heritage and identity. Not many works, however, bring back Philippine mythology through interactive media like video games. AlbuRIOT aims to find this niche by offering the players a unique experience where they will be able to learn the mythological monsters like the Manananggal, Tikbalang, and Aswang as they enjoy cooperative play and competition.

The core problem addressed by this research is the waning awareness of Philippine mythology, in addition to insufficient games that involve local culture significantly. AlbuRIOT will get players to be an albularyo, a Philippine traditional healer, and purify an island full of mythical beasts. The unique power-stealing game mechanic, killing beasts and borrowing their powers temporarily, is used in AlbuRIOT to introduce strategy to survival gameplay. The application of Perlin noise to procedurally generated maps ensures replayability, and Behavior Tree AI creates intelligent and responsive enemy actions. The research aims to demonstrate how the incorporation of cultural elements in game development can enhance player interaction and support the preservation of intangible cultural heritage.

Evidence of such cultural disconnection is observed through surveys that indicate decreasing knowledge of local myths among Filipino youth. The cultural inspiration games' popularity also turns out to be a high probability of AlbuRIOT attracting domestic and international attention. The dynamic enemy AI and procedural map generation are not just technological innovations but also in conformity with the modern gaming trends of unpredictability and adaptive difficulty. Through the synthesis of mythology with innovative game mechanisms, AlbuRIOT is aiming to make learning and gaming a combined process that would awaken interest in Philippine myths once more.

Behind it all lies the dominance of Western and globalized media, which has the tendency to swamp indigenous myths and legends. Filipino learners are learning much more about legends from the rest of the world and not much about their own, hence they are disowning their own cultural heritage. The implications of this issue are more than entertainment, and its potential implications might be at the level of national identity and cultural pride. By offering an enjoyable and educational setting, AlbuRIOT is a solution that is entertaining and educational. Players may learn mythological tales in a game planning setting, promoting an appreciation of Philippine culture through the interactive nature of computer games.

Objective of the Study

The objective of this research is to develop AlbuRIOT, a multiplayer survival game using Philippine mythology as inspiration, with the intention of bringing back the popularity of local folklore using interactive and fun gameplay. The research centers on integrating mythological beings and cultural motifs into fundamental game mechanics, with the use of Perlin noise-based procedural generation for dynamically changing map designs and Behavior Tree AI in creating smart and adaptable enemies. In addition to this, the game will have a multiplayer network system to facilitate cooperative or competitive game modes, engaging the player further and building teamwork or competition.

This research will also develop an improved power-stealing system, enabling players to steal powers from defeated mythological beasts, providing a depth of strategy and immersion. By incorporating culturally sourced visual and sound elements, AlbuRIOT will be not only an entertaining platform but an educational tool which fosters awareness of Philippine mythology. Through iteration of user tests and feedback inspection, the study will assess balance in gameplay, AI behavior, and cultural sincerity to refine overall experience. The results will add to game development by proving how classic folklore can be translated successfully into contemporary digital entertainment.

Scope and Limitations

Scope of the Study
This research aims to create and test AlbuRIOT: A Multiplayer Survival Game Incorporating Philippine Mythology with Perlin Noise-Based Map Generation and Behavior Tree AI for Enemy Mechanics. The game claims to mimic players in the Filipino myths as well as culture representation, fun, and pedagogy. Perlin noise-driven procedural worlds are varied and heterogeneous environments for each play session. The game includes an AI system with a Behavior Tree system that allows the enemies to have adaptive strategies and provides the game with a dynamic simulation of survival. The highlight of the game is the stealing of mythical creatures' powers, which adds a tactical layer to exploration and combat.
AlbuRIOT has cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes in which the player is an albularyo whose goal is to purify an island inhabited by supernatural beings of Filipino mythology like Manananggal, Tikbalang, and Aswang. All the creatures have particular powers that add to the sophistication and level of difficulty of the game. To address multiplayer synchronization problems, the development of the game focuses on minimizing network lag, optimizing server stability, and achieving smooth online gaming. This ensures players are able to engage in competitive and cooperative gameplay modes without disruption in the form of desynchronization or lag.
The power-stealing aspect, by which players gain skills from defeated mythical beings, will be exactly tuned so that it does not add overpowered abilities that will destroy gameplay. The system will be providing tactical options while holding new and veteran players in balance through fairness and challenge. Also, *AlbuRIOT* is determined to be culturally sensitive in presenting Filipino mythical beings. The game will work with cultural consultants to ensure respectful and appropriate treatment of these entities, including player input to maintain both culturally sensitive treatment and fun play.
The geographical scope of the study is in Luzon, Philippines to render diversity feedback and cultural perspective of local relevance. The game is also globally oriented to provide exposure to Philippine mythology to the international gaming community. The study is from 2025 to 2026 and entails research, development, testing, and evaluation phases. This period of time offers a chance for a close examination of how Filipino cultural aspects can be successfully translated into an engaging game experience.
By combining procedural game design, mythology, and multiplayer capability and artificial intelligence puzzle elements, AlbuRIOT will provide a survival experience of immersion and will further foster Philippine cultural heritage. The research is finally hoping to show the potential of video games as a tool for storytelling and cultural heritage through presenting how past narratives are perpetuated and replayed by the means of present-day interactive media.

Limitations of the Study
Even though this study has a broad scope, there are several limitations that could influence the final outcome and conclusions. One of the most significant problems is the game's complexity, including multiplayer survival features, mythological creatures, tactical power-stealing, and procedural map generation. This blend could lead to a steep learning curve, especially for new players, and consequently frustration or a bad first-player experience. In order to balance this, the game will need to offer enough tutorials, progression, and difficulty adjustment to enable players to learn the mechanics incrementally without becoming overwhelmed. In addition, procedural generation balance and fairness in the Perlin noise algorithm and Behavior Tree AI are crucial to providing a clean and pleasant game experience. Any deficiency in these systems would affect gameplay balance and player satisfaction in a negative manner.
For the multiplayer component, server stability issues, online combat lag, and fair matchmaking need to be addressed. Internet infrastructure differences might impact the player-versus-player mode, such as synchronization issues and frustrating experiences. Furthermore, while user testing is primarily performed in the Philippines to be culturally sensitive, the player experience could differ internationally because various cultures would have varying opinions regarding Filipino mythology. To ensure the game is both enjoyable and respectful, meaningful storytelling must be implemented to emotionally connect players with the story and characters. Without having a compelling and understandable story or established lore to their functions and roles regarding the mythical creatures, players will not develop an emotional connection to the experience, diminishing the cultural influence and educational aspect of the game.
Lastly, technological limitations might affect performance. Gamers with low-end hardware or legacy software might have issues with the quality of the game, particularly when it comes to graphical representation and game scalability. The composition of mythical creatures and worlds should find a balance between creativity and realism so that the visual interpretation does not venture too far from traditional representations, or else it will impact the cultural authenticity of the game. Furthermore, the game's procedural map generation, while providing experience diversity, may be limited by computational power. For long-term playability, the game must introduce periodic updates, expansions, or dynamic content to keep the game fresh for frequent players. Without sufficient new content or continuous improvement, the players may become bored, reducing the game's replay value and long-term interest.
