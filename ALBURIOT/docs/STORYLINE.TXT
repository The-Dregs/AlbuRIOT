Narrative
Long before written history and colonial conquest reached the shores of the Philippines, the islands thrived under the quiet balance of spirits and nature. Towering mountains, dense forests, and deep oceans were home to powerful beings that kept the world in harmony. Among the most feared and revered were two celestial titans: Minokawa, the colossal bird whose wings could eclipse the sun, and Bakunawa, the mighty sea serpent believed to devour the moon. These beings, though chaotic by nature, maintained a rhythm that kept both the physical and spiritual realms in balance.
That peace was shattered when foreign forces arrived—explorers, conquerors, and mercenaries lured by tales of god-like creatures that controlled the heavens. Their greed drove them to hunt Minokawa and Bakunawa, hoping to steal divine power from the stars and the sea. Though their campaigns failed, the damage was irreversible. Enraged, the two titans turned their wrath upon the islands. Their cosmic battle fractured the fabric of the spirit world, unleashing an age of chaos.
A Mythic Crisis Across the Three Islands
As the war between Minokawa and Bakunawa escalated, the natural order crumbled. Mythological creatures, once kept in check by divine balance, began to run rampant.
In Luzon, the forests fell silent as the Kapre abandoned their watch and became destroyers. Tiyanak swarmed villages, their cries haunting the night. In the Visayas, Aswang hunted without fear of daylight, and Manananggal soared through skies no longer guarded by the sun. In Mindanao, Tikbalang twisted paths into endless mazes, trapping entire towns. The once-benevolent Diwata, shaken by the chaos, vanished deep into the mountains.
Every corner of the Philippines began to drown in mythic unrest. What were once bedtime stories have become waking nightmares.
The Albularyo’s Calling
In the midst of this spiritual collapse, a new force rises. You are an Albularyo—a healer, spirit-binder, and guardian of ancestral knowledge. Called upon by the elders of Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao, you and a team of fellow Albularyo are tasked with restoring the balance between the mortal and spirit worlds.
Your mission is not to destroy these creatures, but to understand them and reclaim what was lost. The last hope lies in finding Manaul, the forgotten divine bird of peace, once capable of ending wars with a single call. To awaken Manaul, you must journey across the fractured islands, face corrupted spirits, and uncover the true origin of the conflict.
The spirits will not surrender easily. The world remembers the sins of the invaders, and the darkness they left behind still lingers.
Gameplay Overview
AlbuRiot is a multiplayer action-survival game that blends traditional Filipino folklore with an immersive monster-hunting experience. Designed as a simpler, more accessible version of games like Monster Hunter, it focuses on tight co-op gameplay, exploration, and tactical encounters.
Players explore three distinct regions: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. Each island offers unique landscapes, weather, and folklore-based creatures. The map is procedurally generated using Perlin noise, ensuring a fresh experience with every expedition.
You and up to three other players can team up to take on mythological threats using behavior-based AI. Defeated creatures grant temporary powers, such as flight from the Manananggal or supernatural speed from the Tikbalang, which add depth and strategy to combat and traversal.
Aside from hunting, players interact with spirit NPCs, uncover hidden ruins, and gather lore fragments to understand the mythological past of the islands. Choices and outcomes shape how local spirits respond—some may assist, while others may become hostile.

PROLOGUE: The Awakening (Tutorial / Intro Sequence)
Setting: A Rural Fishing Village in Visayas
You begin not as a hero, but as a simple villager, a young fisherman, herbalist, or farmer (player chooses background) living in peace in a coastal barangay. You’ve heard the old stories: of Aswang in the woods, Diwata in the rivers, and Kapre in the mountains, but to you, they were just bedtime tales, faded by time and forgotten by most.
But one night, the sky tears open. A deafening roar rolls across the sea. The moon flickers like a candle in the wind. You awaken to chaos: violent tides, monstrous cries, and twisted shadows climbing from the trees.
Your village is destroyed.
As you run for your life, you are pulled into the dreamlike realm of the spirit world, where an ancient Diwata confronts you. She reveals the truth: you are a descendant of a long-forgotten line of Albularyo, guardians of the balance between the physical and spiritual realms.
You are given a choice: to return to the world as it crumbles... or to awaken the gift within you.
You choose to fight.
With your first ritual performed in desperation, the Diwata marks you as Albularyo, and tasks you with a sacred mission: restore the balance, awaken Manaul, and prevent the collapse of the islands.
From this point, your journey as an Albularyo begins.
