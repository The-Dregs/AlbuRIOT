Now I\u2019ll apply the same pattern across the rest of the managers in subsequent passes unless you want me to prioritize particular ones first.\n\nChanges applied:\n- NetworkManager: unified to RPC across both modes; removed `IsMine` guards in RPC handlers; switched to `AllBuffered` to support late joiners; enabled scene sync.\n- GameManager: unified RPC logic; removed `IsMine` guards; switched to `AllBuffered`; master client is the sole initiator for game-state updates.\n- SceneLoader: always prefers `PhotonNetwork.LoadLevel` when connected or in OfflineMode; this works the same in both modes.\n\nWhat I\u2019m about to do next:\n- Continue the same RPC-unification across the remaining managers (LobbyManager, PlayerSpawnManager, TutorialSpawnManager, PerlinEnemySpawner, QuestManager, QuestAreaTrigger, ShrineManager, MovesetManager, CutsceneManager, DialogueManager, StoryManager, PrologueManager, LoadingScreenManager, SceneTransitionTrigger, TriggerScript, HomeScreenMediaController, FreestyleCameraController). If you\u2019d like a priority order, tell me which are most critical.\n\nKey edits (high-signal):\n- Enabled Photon scene sync on startup so `PhotonNetwork.LoadLevel` applies consistently.\n- Removed `photonView.IsMine` gating inside manager RPC handlers so all clients apply state changes.\n- Used `RpcTarget.AllBuffered` so late joiners and OfflineMode get identical state replay.\n\nCode references\n```64:84:ALBURIOT/Assets/Scripts/Managers/NetworkManager.cs\nvoid Start()\n{\n    PhotonNetwork.AutomaticallySyncScene = true;\n    // log Photon Server Settings to help debug build/connect issues (AppId presence, master-server usage)\n    try\n    {\n        var ss = Photon.Pun.PhotonNetwork.PhotonServerSettings;\n        if (ss != null && ss.AppSettings != null)\n        {\n            Debug.Log($\"NetworkManager: PhotonServerSettings found.

TutorialSpawnManager \u2014 player spawning\n- Spawns directly in offline mode without RPC.\n- Uses RPC only in online mode for synchronization.\n- Added duplicate player check to prevent multiple spawns.\n- Improved error handling: null checks and safer camera setup.\n- Better logging to debug spawn issues.\n\n### 3. CutsceneManager \u2014 player spawn after cutscene\n- Changed to coroutines that wait for the player to spawn.\n- Added retry logic: attempts to find the player with up to 10 tries.\n- Ensured coroutines complete before the manager is destroyed.\n- Improved camera setup with null-safe transforms.\n\n## Changes summary\n\n**CutsceneManager:**\n- Handles offline room creation properly\n- Waits for room before starting cutscene in offline mode\n- Fallback mechanisms if network isn't ready\n- Properly waits for player spawn before destroying\n\n**TutorialSpawnManager:**\n- Spawns directly in offline mode (no RPC needed)\n- Uses RPC only when online and in room\n- Prevents duplicate spawns\n- Better error handling and logging\n\nThe cutscene should now play in both singleplayer and multiplayer, and players should spawn correctly after the cutscene in both modes."

BaseEnemyAI Class**\n- **Unified Structure**: All enemies inherit from this base class\n- **Common Functionality**: Movement, targeting, basic attacks, death handling\n- **Abstract Methods**: Override for enemy-specific behaviors\n- **Event System**: Notifications for enemy death, damage, etc.\n- **Networking**: Built-in Photon PUN support\n\n#### **2. EnemyData ScriptableObject**\n- **Configurable Stats**: Health, damage, speed, ranges, etc.\n- **Visual Settings**: VFX, SFX, debug colors\n- **AI Parameters**: Aggression, intelligence levels\n- **Easy Tweaking**: Change values without code changes\n\n#### **3. EnemyManager**\n- **Centralized Spawning**: Spawn enemies by name or prefab\n- **Batch Operations**: Spawn multiple enemies, clear all, etc.\n- **Range Queries**: Find enemies in specific areas\n- **Event Handling**: Track enemy lifecycle events\n- **Debug Tools**: Visual spawn points, enemy counts\n\n#### **4. EnemyFactory**\n- **Type-Safe Creation**: Create enemies by enum type\n- **Component Setup**: Automatically adds required components\n- **Data Loading**: Loads appropriate EnemyData automatically\n- **Caching**: Efficient resource loading\n\n### **\ud83d\ude80 Benefits**\n\n1. **Eliminates Code Duplication**: Common functionality in base class\n2. **Easy Configuration**: Change enemy stats via ScriptableObjects\n3. **Consistent Behavior**: All enemies follow same patterns\n4. **Easy to Extend**: Add new enemies by inheriting BaseEnemyAI\n5. **Centralized Management**: One manager handles all enemies\n6. **Better Organization**: Clear separation of concerns\n7. **Networking Ready**: Built-in Photon PUN support\n\n### **\ud83d\udccb Migration Plan**\n\n1. **Create EnemyData Assets**: For each enemy type in your project\n2. **Refactor Existing Enemies**: Inherit from BaseEnemyAI instead of MonoBehaviourPun\n3. **Update EnemyManager**: Assign your enemy prefabs to the manager\n4. **Test and Iterate**: Use the factory to create enemies\n\n### **\ud83d\udca1 Example Usage**\n\n```csharp\n// Spawn an enemy\nEnemyManager.Instance.SpawnEnemy(\"Aswang\", spawnPosition, Quaternion.identity);\n\n// Spawn multiple enemies\nEnemyManager.Instance.SpawnMultipleEnemies(\"Tikbalang\", 5);\n\n// Get enemies in range\nvar nearbyEnemies = EnemyManager.Instance.GetEnemiesInRange(playerPosition, 10f);\n\n// Clear all enemies\nEnemyManager.Instance.ClearAllEnemies();\n```\n\nThis system will make your enemy management much more maintainable and scalable!
